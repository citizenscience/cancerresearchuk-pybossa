# Trailblazer Demo!

This project is a demo version of the Trailbalzer project created by Cancer Research UK.

# The Trailblazer Project

The original Trailblazer project explored different approaches to crowdsourcing pathology analysis.
Through 15 iterations we refined and optimised the interface in many different ways, each validated by 
statistical analysis of resulting changes in accuracy. 
Trailblazer enabled us to demonstrate that crowdsourcing can be employed to deliver high-quality cancer pathology analysis, 
through close collaboration with researchers and agile, iterative development processes. 
We were able to achieve an accuracy, relative to trained experts of greater than 95% across multiple cancer types and 
by combining results from fewer than 10 untrained, non-specialist users.

# Pathology Data

The images included in this demo are of lung tissue, most of which include cancer cells.
The tissue samples are about 0.6mm across and have been stained to highlight [EGFR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor).
The project also worked with other tissue types - bladder and oesophageal - and other stain types - ki67, p53 - to ensure the approach was
applicable across a range of types of tissue image.

# The Software

Trailblazer was written using the [PyBossa citizen science platform] (http://pybossa.com).
The JavaScript web UI was developed using a [lean startup] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) approach.
The UI was therefore developed only to the extent necessary to evaluate the way information was presented and the nature of user interaction. 
The UI is not a polished finished product.
Similarly the source code is fit for purpose in the same way - it does not necessarilly conform to coding best practice.
